        <div class="section">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Electoral Vote Simulator</strong> is a Python-based console application designed to simulate an electoral voting process between two candidates. The program allows users to cast their votes, displays the results in real-time, and provides an option to export the results to a CSV file for record-keeping.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The primary purpose of this project is to simulate a voting process, making it an excellent tool for demonstrating Python programming skills. The project showcases the handling of user inputs, the application of conditional logic, and the ability to manage data dynamically. It's ideal for educational settings, interviews, or as a portfolio piece demonstrating practical coding abilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <h3>1. Voting System</h3>
            <p><strong>User Interaction:</strong> Users can cast their votes for either of the two candidates through a simple console interface.</p>
            <p><strong>Vote Validation:</strong> The program ensures that only valid votes are counted, helping prevent errors or invalid inputs.</p>

            <h3>2. Real-Time Vote Counting</h3>
            <p><strong>Instant Feedback:</strong> The program provides immediate feedback after each vote, updating the vote count and informing the user that their vote has been recorded.</p>
            <p><strong>Dynamic Data Management:</strong> All votes are tallied and stored in variables during the program's execution, ensuring accurate tracking of the voting process.</p>

            <h3>3. Final Results Display</h3>
            <p><strong>Summary of Votes:</strong> At the end of the voting process, the program displays the total number of votes each candidate received and the overall total votes cast. This summary is shown directly in the console.</p>

            <h3>4. CSV Export</h3>
            <p><strong>Export Functionality:</strong> The program provides an option to export the final voting results to a CSV file. This feature is particularly useful for keeping a record of the election results or for further analysis.</p>
            <p><strong>Customizable Filename:</strong> Users can specify the name of the CSV file where the results will be saved, providing flexibility in data management.</p>

            <h3>5. User-Friendly Console Interface</h3>
            <p><strong>Clear Instructions:</strong> The program guides users through the voting process with clear prompts and instructions, making it accessible to users of all experience levels.</p>
            <p><strong>Simple Navigation:</strong> Users can easily navigate the voting process, cast their votes, and finish the election with intuitive console commands.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <h3>Python Code Structure</h3>
            <p>The project is structured around a single Python script (<code>main.py</code>) that includes several well-defined functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>cast_vote(vote, candidate_1_votes, candidate_2_votes, total_votes):</strong> This function handles the voting logic, ensuring that the correct candidateâ€™s vote count is updated based on user input.</li>
                <li><strong>display_results(candidate_1_votes, candidate_2_votes, total_votes):</strong> This function is called at the end of the voting process to display the final vote counts for each candidate and the total votes cast.</li>
                <li><strong>export_results_to_csv(candidate_1_votes, candidate_2_votes, total_votes, filename='vote_results.csv'):</strong> This function allows users to save the results to a CSV file, making it easy to store and share the election outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>main():</strong> The <code>main()</code> function serves as the entry point for the program, managing the overall flow of the voting process, including initiating the vote, tallying results, and calling other functions as needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Code Explanation</h3>
            <p>The core logic of the program is contained within the <code>cast_vote</code> function, which checks the user's input, updates the respective candidate's vote count, and increments the total vote count. The <code>display_results</code> function provides a clear summary of the voting outcomes, while the <code>export_results_to_csv</code> function enables the saving of results to a CSV file for external use.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
            <p>To run the Electoral Vote Simulator, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Ensure Python is installed on your system.</li>
                <li>Clone the repository or download the script from <code>https://github.com/jpb1991/python</code>.</li>
                <li>Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the <code>main.py</code> script.</li>
                <li>Run the script using the command: <code>python main.py</code>.</li>
                <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to cast votes for Candidate 1 or Candidate 2.</li>
                <li>Type <code>end</code> to finish voting and display the results.</li>
