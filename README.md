# Electoral Votes Simulator üó≥Ô∏è

Welcome to the Electoral Votes Simulator! This Python application simulates a voting process between two candidates using a user-friendly graphical interface. It allows users to cast votes, see the results, and export the data to a CSV file.

## Features

- **Intuitive GUI**: Simple and interactive interface for an engaging user experience.
- **Customizable Dialogs**: Input dialogs with adjustable sizes for easier data entry.
- **Real-Time Voting**: Cast votes for two candidates and view results instantly.
- **CSV Export**: Save voting results to a CSV file for record-keeping and analysis.
- **Detailed Logging**: Monitor and track user interactions and system activities.

## Prerequisites

Ensure Python is installed on your system. The script uses standard Python libraries, so no additional packages are required:

- `tkinter` (usually included with Python)
- `logging` (standard library)
- `csv` (standard library)
- `random` (standard library)

## Installation

1. **Download the Script**: Obtain the `main.py` script from the repository or another source.
2. **Install Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `main.py`. Execute the script with:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Start the Simulation**:
    - Click the `Start Simulation` button to begin.
    - Enter the names of the two candidates when prompted.
    - Cast your vote by entering `1Ô∏è‚É£` for Candidate 1 or `2Ô∏è‚É£` for Candidate 2.
    - Enter `0Ô∏è‚É£` to end voting and display the results.

3. **View Results**:
    - After voting concludes, the results will be shown on-screen.
    - Choose a location to save the results in a CSV file for future reference.

4. **Handling Ties**:
    - In case of a tie, you will be prompted to re-enter the candidates' names and restart the voting process.
