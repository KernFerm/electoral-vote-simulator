# Electoral Votes Simulator üó≥Ô∏è

Welcome to the Electoral Votes Simulator! This Python program simulates a voting process between two candidates through an engaging graphical user interface (GUI). Users can cast their votes for either Candidate 1 or Candidate 2, and the program will keep track of the votes. When the voting ends, the program displays the final results and exports them to a CSV file.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the script using the following command:

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts to cast your vote.

    - Click the `Start Simulation` button to begin.
    - Enter the names of the two candidates.
    - Cast your vote by selecting the appropriate option (1Ô∏è‚É£ for Candidate 1, 2Ô∏è‚É£ for Candidate 2).
    - Click `0Ô∏è‚É£` to finish voting and see the results.

5. After voting ends, the results will be displayed on the screen and saved to a CSV file in the location you choose.
