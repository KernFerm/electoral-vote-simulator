        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <h3>1. Interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI)</h3>
            <p><strong>Modern UI Design:</strong> The program features a clean, intuitive interface built using Python's Tkinter library. The GUI guides users through each step of the voting process, ensuring an accessible and user-friendly experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Engaging Interaction:</strong> Users interact with the program through buttons and input fields, making the process of casting votes straightforward and engaging. The design of the interface focuses on clarity and ease of use, which is crucial for maintaining user engagement.</p>

            <h3>2. Real-Time Voting Simulation</h3>
            <p><strong>Immediate Feedback:</strong> As votes are cast, the program updates the vote counts for each candidate in real-time. This feature demonstrates the ability to handle dynamic data within an application, providing users with instant feedback on their actions.</p>
            <p><strong>Accurate Vote Tally:</strong> The program ensures that every vote is accurately recorded and attributed to the correct candidate, showcasing attention to detail and accuracy in software design.</p>

            <h3>3. Final Vote Count and Display</h3>
            <p><strong>Comprehensive Results:</strong> After all votes have been cast, the program displays a summary of the total votes for each candidate and the overall number of votes. This summary is presented in a clear and concise format, making it easy for users to understand the results.</p>

            <h3>4. Electoral College Simulation</h3>
            <p><strong>State-by-State Simulation:</strong> The program simulates an electoral college system based on state votes. Each state’s vote count contributes to the overall electoral vote tally, reflecting the real-world electoral process.</p>
            <p><strong>Tie Handling:</strong> In case of a tie in electoral votes, the voting process is automatically restarted to ensure a clear winner, demonstrating the program's capability to handle edge cases.</p>

            <h3>5. CSV Export Functionality</h3>
            <p><strong>Data Export:</strong> One of the key features of this program is the ability to export the final voting results to a CSV file. This functionality is crucial for record-keeping, analysis, and reporting purposes. It also demonstrates practical experience with file I/O operations in Python.</p>
            <p><strong>Customizable Output:</strong> Users can specify the file name and save location for the CSV file, allowing for flexibility in how the data is stored and managed.</p>

            <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
            <p>The Electoral Vote Simulator is implemented using Python and makes extensive use of the Tkinter library for its graphical interface. Below is a breakdown of the key components and their roles:</p>
            <h3>1. GUI Development</h3>
            <p><strong>Tkinter Library:</strong> The Tkinter library is used to create the graphical interface. It includes buttons, labels, and input fields that allow users to interact with the program. The layout is designed for ease of use, ensuring that users can navigate through the voting process without confusion.</p>
            <p><strong>Custom Dialogs:</strong> The input boxes for candidate names are made larger for improved user experience, showing attention to detail in the user interface design.</p>
            <p><strong>Event Handling:</strong> The program uses event-driven programming to handle user interactions. Each button press triggers specific functions that update the program state, such as recording a vote or displaying the final results.</p>
            <p><strong>Logging Mechanism:</strong> The application incorporates a detailed logging system to monitor and record user interactions, errors, and system operations. This logging is essential for troubleshooting, auditing user actions, and enhancing the application's reliability. Logs are maintained with timestamps and detailed event descriptions, making it easier to trace the sequence of actions and identify the root causes of any issues that arise.</p>
