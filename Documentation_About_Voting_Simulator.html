        <div class="section">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The <strong>Electoral Vote Simulator</strong> is a Python-based application that simulates a voting process between two candidates through an engaging graphical user interface (GUI). Users can cast their votes for either Candidate 1 or Candidate 2, and the program will keep track of the votes. When the voting ends, the program displays the final results and exports them to a CSV file for record-keeping.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This project demonstrates the use of Python for creating interactive applications with a focus on GUI development, input handling, and data export capabilities. It serves as an educational tool for understanding basic to intermediate Python concepts and is also suitable as a portfolio piece for showcasing programming skills.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <h3>1. Interactive GUI</h3>
            <p><strong>Engaging User Interface:</strong> The program features a user-friendly graphical interface that guides users through the voting process, making it accessible even for those with minimal technical experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Simple Navigation:</strong> Users can easily start the simulation, enter candidate names, cast votes, and end the voting process with clear on-screen instructions.</p>

            <h3>2. Voting Simulation</h3>
            <p><strong>Real-Time Feedback:</strong> Users cast votes in real-time, with the program immediately updating and displaying the current vote counts for each candidate.</p>
            <p><strong>Final Vote Count:</strong> At the end of the voting process, the program displays the total votes for each candidate and the overall number of votes cast.</p>

            <h3>3. Electoral College Simulation (If Applicable)</h3>
            <p><strong>State-Based Voting:</strong> The program can simulate an electoral college system where votes are tallied based on state-level results, providing a more complex voting scenario (if this feature is implemented).</p>

            <h3>4. CSV Export</h3>
            <p><strong>Export Functionality:</strong> The final voting results can be exported to a CSV file, making it easy to store and analyze the results after the simulation.</p>
            <p><strong>Customizable File Naming:</strong> Users can specify the file name for the exported CSV file, allowing for organized data management.</p>

            <h2>How to Use</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Clone the repository or download the script from <code>https://github.com/jpb1991/python</code>.</li>
                <li>Ensure you have Python installed on your system.</li>
                <li>Run the script using the following command: <code>python main.py</code>.</li>
                <li>Follow the on-screen prompts to cast your vote:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click the <strong>Start Simulation</strong> button to begin.</li>
                    <li>Enter the names of the two candidates.</li>
                    <li>Cast your vote by selecting the appropriate option (1Ô∏è‚É£ for Candidate 1, 2Ô∏è‚É£ for Candidate 2).</li>
                    <li>Click <strong>0Ô∏è‚É£</strong> to finish voting and see the results.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>After voting ends, the results will be displayed on the screen and saved to a CSV file in the location you choose.</li>
            </ol>
